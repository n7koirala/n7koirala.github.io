HEProfiler is a specialized tool designed for in-depth profiling and evaluation of approximate homomorphic encryption (HE) libraries. The paper discusses methodology for consistent performance benchmarking, library-specific behavior analysis, and comprehensive performance metrics, including computation time, memory usage, and parameter trade-offs. HEProfiler enables researchers and developers to compare and optimize homomorphic encryption systems with reproducible and fine-grained measurements, addressing a gap in current cryptographic performance evaluation practices.
