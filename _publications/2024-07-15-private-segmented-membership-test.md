This paper introduces the concept of Private Segmented Membership Test (PSMT), designed to allow clients to securely verify the membership of an element within segmented data sets distributed across multiple data holders. It addresses shortcomings in prior methods such as Private Set Intersection (PSI), Multi-Party PSI (MPSI), and Private Membership Test (PMT), including plaintext dependency, high latency, and data leakage. By leveraging a summation-based threshold homomorphic encryption mechanism, our approach supports a significantly higher number of data holders (up to 4096 in experiments) while ensuring no leakage about the intersection party and eliminating false positives.
