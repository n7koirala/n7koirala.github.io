HyDia is a privacy-preserving facial matching system utilizing fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The framework introduces hybrid approximation techniques and diagonalization strategies to significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy in encrypted biometric comparisons. By combining efficient ciphertext transformations with approximation-aware matching, HyDia achieves practical performance for large-scale deployments without sacrificing security.
