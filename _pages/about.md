- I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Taeho Jung](https://sites.nd.edu/taeho-jung/).

- I am a member of [Data Security and Privacy Lab (DSP-Lab)](https://sites.nd.edu/dsp-lab/) where we aim to explore and resolve security and privacy issues currently existing in the world of data by performing interdisciplinary research in security, privacy and big data.

- My main research interests lie in Applied Cryptography, including lattice-based cryptography, homomorphic encryption, and quantum cryptography. My latest project focuses on Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes and their performances.
