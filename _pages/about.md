- I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Taeho Jung](https://sites.nd.edu/taeho-jung/).

- At Notre Dame, I'm in [Data Security and Privacy Lab (DSP-Lab)](https://sites.nd.edu/dsp-lab/) where we aim to explore and resolve security and privacy issues currently existing in the world of data by performing interdisciplinary research in security, privacy, and big data.

- My main research interests lie in Applied Cryptography, including lattice-based cryptography, homomorphic encryption, and trusted execution environments (TEEs).

- As of 2026, I am working on a heterogeneous trusted-computing framework that uses process-based TEEs (e.g., Intel SGX) as a control plane to orchestrate and attest fleets of VM-based TEEs (e.g., Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP) connected to NVIDIA CC enabled GPUs (e.g., H100, H200), targeting scalable remote attestation and a better trust model for the end-users.

- During the summer of 2025 and 2024, I guided rising sophomores at Notre Dame during the [CSE Summer Enrichment Program](https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/csesummer2024/home) for projects utilizing Intel SGX and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for key generation and distribution and secure data collection and privacy-preserving analytics.

- Served as a STEM Mentor for [Warrior-Scholar Project (2024)](https://omva.nd.edu/programs/warrior-scholar-project/) and mentored active-duty military and veterans in Cryptography during intensive academic bootcamps to support their transition to higher education.

- For the Summer 2022, I completed an internship at [Intel](https://intel.com) as a homomorphic encryption engineer.
